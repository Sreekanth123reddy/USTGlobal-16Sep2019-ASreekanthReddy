Exceptions : -  Exception is an event that occurs in the program which disrupts the flow of execution of the program. It is an runtime interruption .
*When we handle the exception is called exception handling .
*We should use try block  .  we will write the code of lines which cauese exception .
*Catch block  , the possible exceeption that occur in catch block . we need to write  it in catch block
*Once the exception occur in try block , it will go to the catch block  again it will never go to try block 
*one try block have many number of catch blocks.
*Highly recommended to use try , catch block if the code is not dependedent on other lines of code

*whenever there is an exception JVM create the object of exception 
*And it will throws that exception to the method which was responsible for the exception . 
*If the JVM handles the exception , program stops the execution . 
*If the method handles exception , program executes normally 


*Any type of exception can be handled by following try , catch block

try{
-----
}
catch(Exception e)
{
e.printStackTrace();
}

*printStackTrace will prints what is an exception that occured in try block  .

*In finally block we all close the costly resources such as database connection , scanner close
