TypeCasting  :-
*Converting one type to as another type is called "TypeCasting ".
*Primitive  type casting ->IMPLICIT ,Explicit
*Reference type casting

->Lower datatype value is casted to higher data type variable is called "IMPLICIT CASTING" .
 eg : short a =10;
	int b = a;
->When higher data type is casted to lower data type is called explicit casting .
double x =20.35;
int y= (int)x;
ooooo
Reference type casting
 ->converting one reference type to another refernce type

*Without upcasting , its not possible for downcasting .
