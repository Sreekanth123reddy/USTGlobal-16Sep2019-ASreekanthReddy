*class implements Runnavble interface :

class MyThread implements Runnable {
	

}
*Myclass extends Thread class , the Thread class  implements Runnable 
*We can extend the Thread class or implements the Runnable interface for creating the threads .
*start() method is not present , if we need to use start() method we need to create the object by using Thread when our class implemeents Runnable

MyThread t1 = new Thread();
t1.start();

MyRunnable r11 = new  MyRunnable();
Thread t1= new Thread(r11);
t1.start();


Why we have two ways to create a Thread ?
*If my class extends Thread class , then i can't extend any another class . we will get just behaviour of thread class
*If my class implements Runnable interface then i can extend any another classes . Here we get both behavious of Thread class and another class behaviour

*Myclass extends Thread class and also  implements Runnable  ,we will not get any error because run method already overloaded in thread class
