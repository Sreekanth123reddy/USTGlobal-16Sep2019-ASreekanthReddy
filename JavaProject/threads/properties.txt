join() : 
allows other thread for complete execution and then execute the current thread .
sleep() :

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Yield						join						sleep
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*It pauses the execution of the current thread	   *It pauses the execution of the current thread	   	*It pauses the execution of thread for 
and allows other  thread with same priority	 and allows other  thread which is called by join()		particular time what we given
or higher priority


*static					*non-static					*static

*not throws IE				*throws IE					*throws IE

*not overloaded methods			*has overloaded methods				*has overloaded methods

*not final					*final						*not -final


Race Condition : - Multiple threads acting on a same resource , to overcome these we are going for synchronized n


Synchronized : 
	* once we declared method as synchronized  , it will acquire the lock to the object(Object lock) . after completing or finishing the thread 
it will not give access to the other thread . Releases the object lock once the thread is completed . so , it is single threaded 

DeadLock  :-
_____________
wait() : it pause the execution of the current thread and also it releases the object lock .
notify() :which ever the thread waiting for this object will be notify 
	releases the object lock and notify the thread for this object
notifyAll() : releases the object lock and notify all the threads for this object
