JPQL  :  - Java Persistence Query language
JPQL is Java Persistence Query Language defined in JPA specification. It is used to create queries against entities to store in a relational database.
 JPQL is developed based on SQL syntax. But it wonâ€™t affect the database directly.

JPQL can retrieve information or data using SELECT clause, can do bulk updates using UPDATE clause and DELETE clause.
 EntityManager.createQuery() API will support for querying language.

*It is object oriented query language which is used to perform DB operations on persistance entities . Instead of DB table JPQL uses entity object model
to operate the sql query . 

D/B sql and jpql :

*JPQL is related to JPA and sql is related to database .
*JPQL have object queries and sql query have table query .
*JPQL is database indeapendent , and sql is database dependent .

Query interface has some method , the first meethod name getResultList() , it will return the list of results .
The second method is executeUpdate() , when ever we are dealing with DML
