Persistence  : - Persistence class is boot strap class  that is sed to obtain entityManagerFactory
EntityManageFactory is an interface that is used to obtain persistence unit .

* Difference between find and get reference methods
Find() delivers the entity from the cache of the persistence context or if he is not there, it will be loaded from the database.
GetReference() does not load the entity immediately. A proxy( a certain object, a so called "deputy" with enriched methods for loading the actual entity) is returned. So it is a realisation with help of LazyLoading.
Only if the attributes of the proxy or other persistence methods are needed/called the proxy interacts and loads the actual entity from the database.

Persistence life cycle :
1.Transient object : Transient objects exist in heap memory. Hibernate does not manage transient objects or persist changes to transient objects.
2.Persistent Object : Persistent objects exist in the database, and Hibernate manages the persistence for persistent objects.
Persistent objects are maintained by Hibernate

Merge is one of the method to reattached the deatched objects
