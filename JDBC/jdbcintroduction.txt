*Java is both application and language .
*MySql is also an application
*Java application and MySql application need to connect , for that we are using JDBC .
*jdbc API  is used to interact with any database such as RDBMS 


JAVA----->		JDBC------->	MySqlDB

*Connection 	Statement	ResultSet  are interfaces .

*Driver class ->To communicate with DB  , import com.mysql.jdbc.Driver 
-> 4 types of drivers ->ODBC -JDBC,Native PI, Network protocol ,Native Protocol

*Native Protcol is faster and efficiiency when compared to all  driver 
 ->It is .jar  file , we need to attach in our application .
*Jar file is a collection of .class files
*To connect with rdbms , we need jdbc driver .
*register driver .DriverManager helps to register driver class

Step 1 : Load the driver 
	Driver driver = new Driver();
	DriverManager.registerDriver(driver);
