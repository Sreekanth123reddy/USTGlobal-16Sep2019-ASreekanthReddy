Http - Hyper text transfer protocol  
*we have 7 methods but mostly we use 5 Get ,post ,put, delete,options
*To send data to the server we mostly use post request and for fetching we use get 
*When ever we use get request method , the values goes to the address bar  , if we dont metion any thing method in html page by default it will
take Get request 
*If i use post , the url pattern does not contain any query string . 
*When we would want to fetch data from server go for Put  and when ever we want to post data to the server go for Post 
*Post will not put our data in our url
*HttpServlet  provides doPost() ,doGet() , if we use these mostly 
*Request alwasys goes to service method , depend on request it will call doGet or doPost method
*we can use doGet() and doPost() at same time
